# Zomato-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of Zomato!
This mini-project allowed me to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a small dataset from Zomato, a food delivery service company. I gained hands-on experience with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, which are essential for data manipulation and visualization. The project encouraged me to explore the steps to take after acquiring raw data and helped me better understand data through visual representation.
